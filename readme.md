# My site

Welcome to this mess

My website wrote with just basic HTML. CSS - just basic things because who needs more?

OH and PHP because of that pizzaz of having modern interactive sever + client type thing but all conservative so PHP instead of some crazy JS mafia - fuck em.

Apparently swearing in code makes it better but we're not doing it today because evryone is watching and stuff'll get hard to deal with.
