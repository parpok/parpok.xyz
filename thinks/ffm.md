You know what. Fuck react, fuck JS, fuck modern approach to web, fuck bloat. Like what's the point of
making so much logic run on the client. Don't get me started on React Server Components - literally
dumb
idea. Why everyone thinks of PHP or Rails or other sure old system as something bad to use now. Like
for
real - these things get better and better. Like understand the fundamental ideas of the web and how
it
got made and this whole client side app bs stops making sense. - Oh and your website/app will now
run on
older devices so that's a plus. Am I biased because of school - fuck yea Am I rebelling against
stuff
online - fuck yea. IDK man I feel like I'd rather fuck around PHP or even RAILS (without any
experience)
than mess with that Next bs or whatever that JS ecosystem now shills.
