          <h3>I'm sorry Apple but what the fuck</h3>
          <p>I'm sorry but how the fuck some of your APIs have docs so shitty. Like how the fuck StoreKit doesn't have real docs. For real the only thing it has is an example project and couple articles on implementing edge cases for payments in certain regions. WTF apple at least tell me how to start with something basic. Even with your example project a small guide how to get started step by step would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Screen time api. more like screen time mess. Literally the worst Apple experience I had - it feels like I'm back at Native Android land - poor docs that don't help, buggy API that makes the experience even worse. Don't get me started on that "oooh it must be sensitive approach" - how the fuck information on someone being terminally online is sensitive - if they want to hide it they have INCOGNITO TABS, instead no fuck you - implement reports which aren't so easy to work with. And then give them a view - sure sounds approachable - fuck no - why tf a simple string like "1 hour" takes the entire screen is a mistery to me. What the fuck Apple. Whatever I'm sick of it I'd rather go talk to AI on how to take that report data and make it return something else than time - docs said its possible so why it shouldn't.</p>

        <div class="think">
          <h3>Fuck frontend mafia</h3>
          <p>You know what. Fuck react, fuck JS, fuck modern approach to web, fuck bloat. Like whats the point of making so much logic run on the client. Don't get me started on React Server Components - literally dumb idea. Why everyone thinks of PHP or Rails or other sure old system as something bad to use now. Like for real - these things get better and better. Like understand the fundamental ideas of the web and how it got made and this whole client side app bs stops making sense. - Oh and your website/app will now run on older devices so thats a plus. Am I biased because of school - fuck yea. Am I rebelling against stuff online - fuck yea. IDK man I feel like I'd rather fuck around PHP or even RAILS (without any experience) than mess with that Next bs or whatever that JS ecosystem now shills.</p>

          <h3>debugging</h3>
          <img src="/content/mihtuded.jpg" alt="mihru ded inside" style="max-width: 100%;" />
          <p>Shes dead inside just like me - Debugging is somewhat painful. Especially when all things that I came up didn't work.</p>
          <p>Yes I know AI is stupid - I love arguing with my last resort</p>
          <p>Whatever after <i>n</i> amount of hours it starts to work now. Good</p>
        </div>
        <div class="think">
          <h3>Xcode is a liar</h3>
          <p>No your app doesn't run in the background - Xcodes debug tools keep it running - totally they don't make your iPhone go slow. <br>
          Also those background tasks on iOS are limited. No you can't dictate how your app runs when user leaves - thats up to iOS and guys at Cupertino - they will tell when to wake it up.</p>

          <h3>Old car good. New car bad.</h3>
          <p>Old car good - has buttons, good tactile buttons. No big color screens - just small red/monochrome display for the radio and smaller one for climate. It's just good.</p>
          <p>It looks like taken from the future. The usefull future. Not that one terminally online people cry about.</p>
          <p>However if you want fancy things like Bluetooth then sorry - not for you. Replace your stereo or <i>THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS READY TO PAIR</i></p>
          <img src="/content/audi.JPEG" alt="audi interior from 2008" style="max-width: 100%;" />
          <p>Still pure perfection and better than Tesla style slop. - even if BMWs looks somewhat nice with those RGBs. And I hate BMW interiors - at least on late 2000ns BMWs - I find them ugly. On later ones it started to get better.</p>
