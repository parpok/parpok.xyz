Old car good - has buttons, good tactile buttons. No big color screens - just small red/monochrome
display
for the radio and smaller one for climate. It's just good.
It looks like taken from the future. The usefull future. Not that one terminally online people cry
about.
However if you want fancy things like Bluetooth then sorry - not for you. Replace your stereo or <i>THE
BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS READY TO PAIR</i>

Audi A3 8P interior - how gorgeous
Still pure perfection and better than Tesla style slop. - even if BMWs looks somewhat nice with those
RGBs.
And I hate BMW interiors - at least on late 2000s BMWs - I find them ugly. On later ones it started
to get
better.
